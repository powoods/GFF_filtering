# GFF_filtering
Simple scripts to filter GFF or GTF files for various features.

This repo contains a python script that can be used to filter GFF files for specific genomic features such as 'gene' or 'mRNA' as well as select features on specific contigs.

Version 3 of the function added the ability to specify genomic windows on specific contigs to extract gff feature coordinates.
